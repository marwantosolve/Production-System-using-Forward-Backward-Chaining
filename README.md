## In this assignment, you will build a simple Production System capable of inferring new facts based on a set of predefined rules and initial facts using Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining techniques.
### What You Need to Do:
#### Read Rules and Facts from Files
You will be provided with two text files:

rules.txt: Contains all the production rules

facts.txt: Contains a list of known initial facts.
#### You must parse both files and convert them into a structured format for processing.
#### Implement Forward Chaining from scratch
#### Implement Backward Chaining from scratch
#### Print facts each cycle in two algorithms
